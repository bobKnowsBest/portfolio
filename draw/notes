This is a drawing application that clients can create polygon features from and also store those features permanently in a database.

The program requires the client to select a type of feature to digitize.
In the case of this application, conservation practices (wetlands, bioreactors, etc.) are created.

Features have to be created inside an edit session.

Features are appended to the db once the client double clicks.

Once a feature is added, all features in the database are added, this could be improved.

The program does not support toggling layers on and off.  This should be included.

The program only supports polygons, though points and lines are used to generate the polygons.

The program does support deleting features.  Clients can delete features by clicking on the pop-up associated with the feature.
  Though it's pretty user friendly, the delete option could be improved with a select feature option.  
  Additionally, if multiple people are going to use the application you would likely want limit delete options to those that
    created the features.  This would require tracking the polygons and adding a username variable to the JSON string stored in
    the db.
    
The database is very simple and consists primarily of a JSON string stored as text.
    The JSON representation makes changing the functionality for different scopes rather easy.
    Postgres was used to create the db.  MongoDB may be a better option.
