Program automates state level workflows for Iowa's 99 counties.  
The script prompts for user input which should be a list of files from the state's GIS website.
Data is output as a JPEG and mxd file.  Easy updates are possible with the inclusion of the mxd file.

Program is limited in the sense that one reference map template and all necessary layer symbology files must be exist in order to
generate the maps.  

Future works/updates should address renaming of legend items to something more appropriate than file names and possibly
include Arcpy's panning funcitonality.

This program gets done in minutes what would otherwise take hours to complete.
