      Notes on the development of the page.  This page consists of custom CSS and CSS3.  All frames with user functionality or display
	  are contained in a body container. There are four frames or classes within the body container.  
	  The first class is the header class.
      Inside the header class is a custom image I created with Microsoft paint.  The image height and width was set to the value assigned to the
      class height and width.  
	  The second class is the NavSidebar class.  The text with my information is included in the NavSidebar class.
	  9 codes were used inside the NavSidebar container.  The first two deal with the links to my academic institutions and a picture.  
	  Next are a set of codes dealing with a mouse click and mouse over command.  Below that is a separate div container that holds my drawing tools. I have also included a
	  custom basemap toggle.  On the right of the NavSidebar class you will see scroll bar.  Adding the scroll bar is very simple and gives
	  you added functionality.  Lastly, I have included what are actually two codes performing one function for the user.  If you scroll down to the
	  bottom of the container you will see a button that gives you the option to toggle text off and on.  This is a simple example of a 
	  powerful function.  What allows me to do toggle the text off and on is a set of jquery commands.  Again, two codes were used to give the user
	  the text toggle function.  Both codes are essentially the same with one word changed.  The first word is "hide" and the second is "toggle".
	  By putting the hide command in first the text loads hidden on the page.  This ability is essential when building professional pages.
	  Often times we will use this type of expression to show different categories of a users homepage such as "Friends", "Updates", and "Messages"
	  without having to load an entirely new html document.  
	  Next we have the content class container.  There is really only one thing going on in this class
	  container.  As you can see, my page has a very large map on it.  This map was acquired from ESRI and a link to their respective css page is included.
	  ESRI has their javascript and css setup so that it is necessary to include links to their css page.  
	  Lastly, we have a footer class container.  The footer consists of custom text designed in the css sheet and text information telling the user the last time the page was updated.

<p65><center><p99>Education</p99><br><p98>I hold a Bachelor's of Science Degree in 
Environmental Science and a Graduate Certificate in GIS.  I received my degree and certificate from
 Iowa State University.  I also attended the United States Military Academy at West Point.  I have
  conducted research using LANDSAT imagery that was used to estimate trophic states of various lakes
   in the state of Iowa.  Although my research replicated steps done by other professionals, I
    was able to produce correlations between actual measurements and estimates of 99%.  Traditionally,
	 correlations of 77%-83% were considered acceptable.  The higher correlations could be attributed to
	  a number of reasons.  First, I used a newer satellite that was in its first year of
	   operation so the satellite might be better suited to the research.  The satellite I used
	    was LANDSAT 8.  Additionally, the year I estimated values for could have had more homogeneous
		 relationships between the actual and estimated values.  One other reason could be that the equation
		  I used was only in its first year of operation.  For the earlier satellites a standard equation was used for every year.  Perhaps
		  the USGS should produce an equation each year.  Nonetheless, my research was notable but
		  further work must be done before any conclusions can be made.</p98><br><br><p97>Undergraduate GPA: 3.2 <br> Graduate GPA: 3.6</p97> 
		  
		  <br><br><p99>Work Experiences</p99><br><p98>I have worked in a number of different industries in my short career.  I served in the US Military for five years.  During
		   my time in the military I served on a route clearance team in Baghdad, Iraq conducting EOD missions.  My unit intercepted over 700 improvised explosive devices and left the theatre 
with more bombs disposed than any unit up to the time we left.  I was also fortunate enough to serve as a Cadet at West Point.  West Point was a awesome experience and introduced me to cutting
edge academics.  I have also done research work at the academic level and worked in a number of environmental areas.  I have worked for commercial environmental consultants and also in the
 non profit sector.  I enjoy environmental work and I love working with computers.</p98><br><br><p97>Employers:<br>US ARMY, Iowa State University, Trileaf Corporation, University of Iowa</p97><br><br>
<p99>Hobbies</p99><br><p98>I enjoy all sorts of activities.  I love to run and hike.  In the past I have completed a half marathon and climbed Mount Everest.  I often go on vacation to 
Colorado where I enjoy white water rafting and just being out in nature.  Although you can find me outside most of the time I also enjoy music.  I play the guitar and I cherish good music.
 My favorite artists are Jeff Beck, Tommy Emmanuel and Bob Dylan.  I listen to all sorts of music but I love jazz and folk music the most.  I even get into old 19th Century wagon music from
  time to time.  Throw a fiddle in a song I will love it.</p98><br><br><p97>Favorite Song:<br>A Day In The Life by the Beatles</p97><br><br><p99>Places Lived</p99><br>
<p98> I have lived all over the world.  I am originally from Virginia.  I was born in Hopewell, Virginia.  I moved to Germany when I was young and lived there for the last years of the Cold
 War.  My family traces it routes back to Italy and Ireland.  My paternal grandparents are first and second generation Americans.  They settled in NYC and most of my family still lives there.
I have also lived in New York and in New Jersey for brief periods of my life.  Iowa is currently home for me and I love it here.</p98><br><br><p97>Places I Want To Visit:<br>
London, Africa, China and Outer space
