//use two forward slashes to show comments in javascript
//html page consists of different tags
//you have the < html > tag that wraps everything
//you show the end of an html tag with a forward slash < / html >
//the head tag is where you put your calls to external javascript pages
//you can also define your own javascript inside the head tag
//style can be set inside the head tag or through an external css page
//this program is calling an external css page
//css defines what colors you will use in your page
//there are three primary ways we define style properties in css 
//the first way is to reference the tag
//if you look at the css page you will notice how the html and body tags are defined
//to reference the tags you just write the name of the tag html{whatever properties you want}
//the second way to define css is by referencing the id of an element
//we reference ids by using the # character, just like when we define #div1, it's the id
//the third way is to reference a class, this is done with a period before the tag name
//the third way would be something like .yourClass
//we don't reference elements by class as often as by tag type or by id
//no classes were used in this page
//the style tag looks like < style > 
//don't use the extra whitespace inside the tags, just showing examples
//all your tags should look like the ones shown in this page



//var map is a global variable, we set the value inside the function below
//we make it global so it can be used in other functions
var map;


//this is a function definition
//very similar to java syntax
function makeMap(){
		map = L.map('map',{ center: [41.83969, -87.663776], zoom: 4});
		L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', { attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>' }).addTo(map);

<!-- 
this is how we leave comments in html
note that it's used on multiple lines and different from comments 
used defined in javascript
it's basically a tag with a leading exclamation point and two simple dashes --
the end of the comment is shown with two dashes and the tag symbol
you place all your comments inside this section
-->

<!-- 
another simple comment
-->


<!-- 
below is where we define the body tag
the body tag is very important
it's where all your div elements will go and where the map goes
think of the javascript as the technical side and the body section
as your graphical user interface
all the css you define will show in the elements below
the body tag is also making use of a very helpful event listener
when the page loads the function makeMap is called in the javascript

-->
<body onload="makeMap()">


<!-- 
the tag below is where our map goes
note that it's in a div container
the id is map
-->
<div id="map"></div>

   

</body>
</html>
