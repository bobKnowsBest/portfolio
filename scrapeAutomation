This is an application that scrapes well permitting data from the following link:
    https://cogcc.state.co.us/COGIS/DrillingPermitsList.cfm
    
The program also automates the production of county level maps by placing 
a simple point at the location of each well in a particular county

Program currently takes text input but could be improved by using select tags instead

The county must be spelled correctly and must be in all caps

Runtime varies, larger counties take quite a while as over 2000 links must be opened
