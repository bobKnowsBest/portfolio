This program scrapes permitting data from the following website  https://cogcc.state.co.us/COGIS/DrillingPermitsList.cfm

The application acquires data from an html table and makes connections to each sites individual homepage

The program also includes the necessary functionality for plotting points on a map that represent the location of each well

Clients can export the maps to their own html page

The same function that is used to create the html pages could be used for writing data to text files

Runtime varies based on the county and server speed
	- Lincoln County takes between 20-40 seconds on average
	- Baca County takes between 10-20 seconds on average
	- Larger counties take close to ten minutes as over 2000 connections have to be made

A few improvements could be made, each of which are discussed below

(1) If a lat lon value does not exist for a well the program will not work
	- I tested the program with many counties and did not encounter any problems
	- An easy fix would be to include another iterator that checks if values are within a range of five or ten of each other
	- The proposed addition would require nesting

(2) The program is currently gathering the county name and lat/lon values
	- Similar approaches could be used for other values in the table located on the main page
	
(3) Should use some timeout or check if a request comes back empty
	- currently the client will just have to resubmit their request if data doesn't come through
	- better to use something like 3 loops and recursively call the ajax function with parameter "option2" equal to 1

(4) Use select tags rather than text input

(5) Issue with Firefox & IE 
	- not a major concern given the intended use
	
	
Use Instructions
	- Use in Chrome or Edge
	- should type in name of the county exactly as it appears in the table, use all caps
	
Map Notes
	- program simply adds a point at the location of each well
	- could build on this program by incorporating clustering, popup windows, custom markers and choropleth mapping
